<h2>Title of the Project</h2> : Cotton Diseases Classification Using ResNet-50 for Precision Agriculture
Abstract:
Deep Learning is a technology that is used to classify and identify images. Detecting diseased plants and acting accordingly is very helpful in the agricultural business. The industrial sector is dominated by cotton, one of the most significant cash crops and sources of fiber. Diseases caused by different kinds of bacteria, Virus, and Fungi are one of the main issues with cotton crops. So, it's important to determine the type of disease prior to their spreading, classifying it, and applying the appropriate remedies. In order to classify these cotton diseases, Resnet-50, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, is being used. It is a very deep neural network that has 50 layers and can recognize very complex features and patterns in images.
