Title of the Project : Cotton Diseases Classification Using ResNet-50 for Precision Agriculture
Abstract:
Deep Learning is a technology that is used to classify and identify images. Detecting diseased plants and acting accordingly is very helpful in the agricultural business. The industrial sector is dominated by cotton, one of the most significant cash crops and sources of fiber. Diseases caused by different kinds of bacteria, Virus, and Fungi are one of the main issues with cotton crops. So, it's important to determine the type of disease prior to their spreading, classifying it, and applying the appropriate remedies. In order to classify these cotton diseases, Resnet-50, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, is being used. It is a very deep neural network that has 50 layers and can recognize very complex features and patterns in images.
Objectives:
 To develop a model for the detection and classification of cotton crop diseases using ResNet-50 architecture.
 To improve the accuracy and efficiency of cotton crop disease detection and classification with the help of deep learning techniques.
 To enable early detection of cotton crop diseases, which can lead to timely and appropriate management strategies to prevent the spread of diseases and reduce yield losses.
 To provide a cost-effective and scalable solution for cotton crop disease detection and classification 
Dataset Description:
Name of the Dataset: Cotton leaf disease dataset
Description:
 The dataset contains different images of cotton crop leaf diseases .
 The images are classified in multiple folders according to their disease name.
 The dataset has large number of images and used to get more trained data.
